What is GTFS format?
-------------------------------------------
The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is a data specification that allows public transit agencies to publish
their transit data in a format that can be consumed by a wide variety of software applications.
Today, the GTFS data format is used by thousands of public transport providers.
GTFS is split into a static component that contains schedule, fare, and geographic transit information and a real-time
component that contains arrival predictions, vehicle positions and service advisories.
